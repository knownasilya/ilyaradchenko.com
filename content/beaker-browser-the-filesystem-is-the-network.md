I've been following a project called [Beaker Browser](https://beakerbrowser.com/), which is a browser build on top of decentralized tech called [dat](https://dat.foundation/) (yeah, a confusing name), and just wanted to write a quick post about why I think it's a really cool project. This post was inspired by a [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/pfrazee/status/1217049494363295744) that [Paul Frazee](https://twitter.com/pfrazee) (one of the creators of Beaker) posted earlier this week.
