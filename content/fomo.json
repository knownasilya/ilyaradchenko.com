I knew\nabout my bad habit, of picking up the phone and opening Twitter any time there\nwas a free moment or a time of silence.

I analyzed\nthis bad habit (did I mention that this was a bad habit?) and realized that I\nwas doing it because I was afraid to miss something happening in the tech\ncommunity, and specifically the Ember [http://emberjs.com]  community.

Otherwise, your quest for change is like a boat without a rudder.\n– James Clear (Atomic Habits, page 40)This section really resonated for me and\ntold me what I already knew. And it's this: I won't change my habits if I don't\nremember (or know) who I am. Notice how I said \"who I am\" instead of \"who I want\nto be\". The reason this is important to me is because I have a solid identity\nthat is defined by my relationship with God. I need to remember who I am (a\nchild of God) so that I can focus on being who I am already. This sounds a bit\nstrange, but in Christianity, there is an idea, \"already but not yet\", which\nillustrates that there is an ultimate reality already, but the time-based\nversion of that reality is still catching up. God already sees me as His son,\neven though presently I have bad habits and sin because Jesus the perfect Son of\nGod has paid for my sins (past, present, and future) and called me his co-heir.</p>\n<p>I really needed to remember that my identity and worth are not in how current I\nam in the Ember scene or how much I know. It's not in my job or my own vision of\nmy future, but my identity and worth are in my relationship with God.</p>","content":"I have to be honest, I've only picked up on this term about a year ago (maybe\nlonger) and at that time I didn't have any connection with the idea.
