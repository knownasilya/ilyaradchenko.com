I have to be honest, I've only picked up on this term about a year ago (maybe
longer) and at that time I didn't have any connection with the idea. A couple of
months ago, I inadvertently stumbled on it again while reading Atomic Habits by
James Clear [https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits], and what an impact it had.

One of the ideas in that book talks about cues and cravings, in regard to making
good or bad habits. An example that James makes is in regard to checking your
phone, it goes like this:

Cue: A phone buzzes with a new text message.
Craving: You want to learn the contents of the message.
Response: You grab the phone and read the text.
Reward: You satisfy your craving to read the message. Grabbing your phone
becomes associated with your phone buzzing.
– James Clear (Atomic Habits, page 51)This example stirred something within me
because at that time I was dealing with checking Twitter way too much. I knew
about my bad habit, of picking up the phone and opening Twitter any time there
was a free moment or a time of silence. What I didn't know, was the reasoning
behind why I was checking it so often. Mainly because I had not taken the time
to analyze my habits.

The process of behavior change always starts with awareness. You need to be
aware of your habits before you can change them.
– James Clear (Atomic Habits, page 66)This is where FOMO, or the fear of missing out,  comes into play. I analyzed
this bad habit (did I mention that this was a bad habit?) and realized that I
was doing it because I was afraid to miss something happening in the tech
community, and specifically the Ember [http://emberjs.com]  community. I kept
analyzing and realized that I had the same bad habit with Github, which usually
occurred after Twitter had no content. So what now?

The first step is not what  or how, but who. You need to know who you want to
be. Otherwise, your quest for change is like a boat without a rudder.
– James Clear (Atomic Habits, page 40)This section really resonated for me and
told me what I already knew. And it's this: I won't change my habits if I don't
remember (or know) who I am. Notice how I said "who I am" instead of "who I want
to be". The reason this is important to me is because I have a solid identity
that is defined by my relationship with God. I need to remember who I am (a
child of God) so that I can focus on being who I am already. This sounds a bit
strange, but in Christianity, there is an idea, "already but not yet", which
illustrates that there is an ultimate reality already, but the time-based
version of that reality is still catching up. God already sees me as His son,
even though presently I have bad habits and sin because Jesus the perfect Son of
God has paid for my sins (past, present, and future) and called me his co-heir.

I really needed to remember that my identity and worth are not in how current I
am in the Ember scene or how much I know. It's not in my job or my own vision of
my future, but my identity and worth are in my relationship with God.
