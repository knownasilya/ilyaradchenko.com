I've been listening to a few podcasts in several different categories and wanted
to share some of those with you.

Development


 * EmberMap [https://embermap.com/podcast]  - An Ember.js focused podcast with
   hosts Sam and Ryan, where they talk about not only Ember.js, but product
   development in general. Lots of insight here and always a fun listen.
 * The Frontside [https://frontside.io/podcast/]  - A podcast from the Frontside
   consultancy which has historically been in the Ember.js community and
   recently have released the Microstates.js library. This podcast recently did
   a reboot, and I'm excited to hear more of that.
 * Build Your SaaS [https://saas.transistor.fm/]  - A podcast documenting the
   journey that two co-founders are going down while building their SaaS
   (Trasistor.fm, podcast hosting service). Real and insightful at the same
   time.
 * Art of Product [https://open.spotify.com/show/4AFHekKU9OMJnS0GLSG5sX]  - The
   journey of two startup founders n the process of building their products.
   Lots of nuggets and just raw honesty regarding the challenges and successes
   of being a founder and building good products.
 * Full Stack Radio [http://www.fullstackradio.com/]  - Adam Wathan does a great
   job putting together great topics and interviews in the web development
   scene.
 * Syntax [https://syntax.fm/]  - Nice show for some quick tips and topics for
   those that work for themselves in web development. Pretty laid back and
   relatable show.
 * DatCast [https://dat-cast.hashbase.io/]  - A look into the dat community and
   the work going on in projects like the Beaker Browser. Only a few episodes.

Christian


 * Ask Pastor John [https://www.desiringgod.org/ask-pastor-john]  - Short
   snippets of answers to questions that are asked of Pastor John Piper, author
   and speaker. Lots of deep and insightful material here.
 * Marriage After God
   [https://marriageaftergod.com/category/marriage-after-god-podcast/]  - Just
   started to listening to this one, but it's a refreshing and relatable podcast
   about marriage for a Christian from a couple. They are very open and honest
   about their own struggles and failures.
 * Courageous Parenting [https://courageousparenting.com/episodes/]  - This is
   probably one of the most impactful podcasts that I've listened to recently.
   There is so much sound advice and practical teaching and it comes straight
   from the Bible. The hosting couple is relatable and transparent.
 * Sojourn Sermons [http://www.sojourntraverse.com/sermons/]  - Technically not
   a podcast, but it's the church we attended in Traverse City and really love
   the quality and gospel centeredness of Matt's sermons. Currently doing the
   series on the book of James from 2015.

Thinking Differently


 * seanwes [https://seanwes.com/podcast/]  - Lots of great content about
   building a business, having an impact and making a difference from Sean and
   Ben. Been listening to their stuff for years.
 * Office Hours [https://discoverpraxis.com/office-hours/]  - How to be your own
   credential and not put all (or any) of your hope into a college degree. Lots
   of light hearted humor, but also packed with deep and insightful wisdom for
   making your career.
 * Forward Tilt [https://open.spotify.com/show/1u1u8amAwS1zDZhqYOIg0w]  -
   Leaning into being the the person people want to hire. Small nuggets that are
   easy to listen in small sessions and the podcast is finished.
 * Crash Podcast [https://crash.co/blog/tag/podcast/]  - Stories of how people
   have crashed their careers in inventive and interesting ways.
