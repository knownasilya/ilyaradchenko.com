I'm excited to announce that in just over a week I'll be joining Crash
[https://crash.co]  to build the vision of helping you show your value while
starting/changing a career.

Crash is building the category of ‚ÄùCareer Launch" because the college degree is
mostly an outdated solution from the pre-internet age and usually comes attached
with overwhelming debt. The reason why I'm so eager to get started is because I
believe in the vision of enabling young people to realize and show their
potential without the chains of debt. What Crash offers isn't just a product to
help you, but also a mindset shift to cause you to think differently about
yourself, not only in the workplace, but also personally.

Beyond the goals, I'm glad to be working with a super focused team, which is all
the more rewarding. I'll be joining on to help build the products and the
engineering team with Dave Wasmer [https://davewasmer.com/]. I'll continue to
work with the tools I love, like Ember.js, TypeScript, and Node.js; as well as
learning some new ones like GraphQL. I'm also looking forward to continuing to
contribute to the open-source community.
