Many people have written blog posts for #EmberJS2019 about where they want to
see Ember headed in the next year or so. I'll add only one item of my own, since
there are already many ideas in the pot. I believe we need to shift our
mentality a bit.

The Making Of Conventions
Conventions come out of many failed experiments that have been run on real use
cases, i.e. production apps. The Ember community loves conventions and cares
about productivity, which unfortunately comes with a price, staying on the
happy-path without the needed experimentation required for new conventions.

For the pit-of-incoherence to be fruitful and push us up the
hilltop-of-coherence, we as developers need to put ourselves out there and learn
some lessons off the happy-path. It wont be easy, because it will cost us time,
money, and failure. I think this step is especially hard for Ember developers
because of the ethos that Ember has built.

Fragmentation Results
Inevitably fragmentation will occur. Some people might take their experiments
too far, or abandon them. Other experiments might fail. Yes these are risks that
exist, but should not stop us. The goal is to take the best fragments and build
them up into a beautiful mosaic.

At the end, when we reach the hilltop-of-coherence, some fragments will be left
in the valley, maybe most of them. We do after all need alternatives and
different views to see the flaws in our designs. Let's not hold on too tightly
to our ideas and code, but focus on unity out of our individual ideas.

A Greater Danger
If we don't take up the cause to experiment for the greater good of the
community, for building it up, then we'll just keep chasing the competition
instead of building those conventions that can only be done by experimentation
and failure. Ember will essentially become obsolete as it chases the other
frameworks.

  This doesn't mean that we don't learn from the wider web community or that we
don't adopt great ideas, but it does mean that we have our beliefs, our "why",
and we should filter all great ideas through that "why". Here's to a year of
experimentation and uniting in greater focus and vision as the Ember community.
