The problem for me is\nthat I get excited and start putting in lots of work at the start and slowly get\ntired and move on to the next interesting idea that I have. Then it eats away at\nme in the back of my mind, because I wasn't able to finish the project.</p>\n<p>With my current project [https://github.com/loaves-and-fishes/community-groups],\nI decided to change things, because doing the same thing, hoping for different\nresults is literally the definition of insanity. I've had this project idea on\nmy mind for the last several years and it has grown in scope over that time. I\nhope to ship this project, so I have primarily written this for myself. Having\nsaid that, I do hope that it also helps you in your side-project journey.</p>\n<p>Do Only One Project\nIf things were going to be different, I'd have to forget about all other\nprojects on my backlog, and be focused on this single project. This means no\ngoing after any new shiny ideas, or resurrecting old projects. All other\nprojects are on hold while the current one is active. This will help my mind and\nmy time to be focused.</p>\n<p>Make It Manageable\nMy idea started out small, but has grown over the last few years. If I was to\ntackle that whole idea as my side project, I'd be completely overwhelmed. So\ninstead I've segmented my idea into 3 parts, and chose one of those parts.</p>\n<p>Even one of the parts is big enough to overwhelm. Now it's time to trim down and\nsee what is the smallest app that I can ship that would be a useful tool for my\naudience. This step is important, because products always have more work than\nyou expect.</p>\n<p>Keep Experimentation Minimal\nEvery time I start a new project, I want to try some new tech. Usually this\nkeeps compounding because I try to experiment with multiple areas of the app.\nFor example, my main expertise is in Ember.js [https://emberjs.com/], but I\nwanted to try Polymer for a side project. I realized pretty quickly that I\nshould not experiment at such a big level, because I don't know the tech and\nwill spend more time learning then building my app.</p>\n<p>For my current side project, I decided to experiment with functional/utility\nCSS, i.e. TailwindCSS [https://tailwindcss.com]. This has worked out well so\nfar. It lets me move fast and not have to go all in if I don't want to. Plus the\ncore is still CSS, so I'm not learning something huge.</p>\n<p>Gate Keep Scope Creep\nAs I build the app, I will see small issues that could be addressed to help the\nexperience. These small fixes or enhancements will only grow the size of my\nproject, growing the distance from where I am to where I need to be to ship this\nproject. My goal is to ship something, after that I can reevaluate.</p>\n<p>For example, while building a members list I saw an opportunity to add a\nmultiple tab UI to help distinguish/filter members that were pending on\ninvitation. This is probably something that will eventually make it in, but at\nthis time it's only distracting from shipping my first version. It's better if\nthe users driver that development, or once the app is established.</p>\n<p>Set Personal Checkpoints\nIt's very easy to lose track of when I last worked on my side project,\nespecially I didn't record anything or set any expectations. All of a sudden a\nyear has gone by and I have little to show for it. The first step is to set an\ninternal deadline that I will try to reach. The second step is to split up\nchunks of work into checkpoints of sorts. With this kind of setup I'll have an\nend in sight and stepping stones that will help me track your progress.</p>\n<p>I'm going to start doing that by using the \"Projects\" feature in Github. This\ndoesn't introduce any new tools to my workflow, which I think is important to\nkeep the overhead small.</p>\n<p>Work In Public\nWhen no one knows what I'm up too, it's easy to just give up or move on to the\nnext big thing. Once I'm accountable, things change, because I've involved\nothers. It's a form of internal motivation, as well as external. For programming\nside-projects this usually starts as working in public with an open repository\nright from the beginning.

Beyond that, I also\nincluded it in a blog post (this one).</p>\n<p>Ship It\nThis might sounds silly, but this is probably the biggest step to have a focused\nside-project. If I never ship my side-project, then I don't really know if I\nenjoy the full process.
