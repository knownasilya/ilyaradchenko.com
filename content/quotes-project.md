Recently I've been reading more non-fiction, specifically Christian non-fiction
writing. During my reading I've been encountering many uplifting and deep quotes
from authors of the past as well as modern day authors. I realized that I've
read many quotes in the past, but for some reason this time I was convicted (or
something) that I should record the quotes that I find beneficial for myself.

Not all those who wander are lost. — J.R.R. Tolkien

With this idea in mind, I decided to make my quote list opensource, so that it
can be accessed by a different audience than just people on Twitter. Since I'm a
web application developer, I figure that I have greater influence in that area,
so Github seemed to be the best place for these quotes. Not to make a greater
name for myself, but to have these quotes be a blessing and a beginning for
someone.

He is no fool who gives what he cannot keep to gain that which he cannot lose. —
James Elliot

So this is the repo [https://github.com/knownasilya/quotes]  along with the
"polished" site [http://knownasilya.github.io/quotes/]. If you enjoy the quotes,
feel free to star the repo. Also if you find a quote that makes sense for the
list, please submit a pull request.
