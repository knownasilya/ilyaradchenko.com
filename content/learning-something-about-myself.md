This week has been a whirlwind of things, but the biggest of those is a decision
to move back to the east coast. Coming to this decision has shown me, more
clearly than ever, that I'm scared of radical changes in my personal life. In
the past, I would have said that I like change, and that is partly true, at
least in the sphere of work mainly with technical things. This experience has
shown me otherwise.

I'm learning that radical, fast change, is hard for me. Maybe it's not the
change itself, but making that decision to make that change, when it touches so
many parts of my life. Looking at the craziness of this week, I can see that
this experience is good. I'm looking forward to this next adventure for my
family. Looking at this season of time that I had with my family, has been very
good and I have peace about this change as we make the move back.
