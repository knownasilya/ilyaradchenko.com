In my [last post](https://ilyaradchenko.com/ember's-nested-routes-and-urls-explored) I mentioned how nested routes don't make sense sometimes, which means that they do have their uses at other times, which I want to cover here. I think the example I used in my last post wasn't clear enough, because what I meant to communicate is that if you want a nested URL structure, it doesn't always mean you need nested routes. I'd like to cover a couple scenarios that help being nested.
