I've heard this concern from at least two companies in my time with Ember and have seen it voiced on social media many times as well. The concern is this: we'll have more access to developer talent if we switch to React. On the surface this sounds wise, but I think there is more to it.

I'm writing about this to get it out of my head, and to see if my argument holds water.

## Is It üçé vs üçä?
Ember's lack of popularity obviously affects the hiring pool of Ember developers. If Ember was just another view library like React, our conclusion would be that a switch makes sense, but that's not the case. While both Ember and React have an ecosystem of addons/libraries, Ember is a framework while React is a library. Ember includes an opinionated folder structure, a router, data management, services, built-in grade-a testing, and an awesome build system. If you wanted a more fair comparison you'd compare React and Glimmer (Ember's rendering library). 

## Are The Pools The Same?
